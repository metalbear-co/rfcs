## Summary
[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Any changes to `mirrord` (or other MetalBear products) should focus on solving a problem that our users, 
customers or ourselves are having.

This section should explain this problem in detail, including necessary background.

It should also contain several specific use cases. This can then be used to guide the design of the feature.

This section should focus on *real-world impact*, not solution details.

## Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the product and you were teaching it to another engineer.

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature in terms of examples and typical workflows.
- Explaining how users should think about the feature, and how it impacts the way they use the product.
- If applicable, provide sample configuration snippets, CLI commands, response, info or error messages, custome
resource templates, etc.
- If applicable, describe how this interacts with existing product features. Using `mirrord` as an example, how
this affects existing features such as file ops, traffic mirroring/stealing, fetching remote env, DNS, etc. 

## Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

## Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

Consider:
- Implementation complexity
- Maintenance burden
- Performance impact
- Breaking changes or backward compatibility
- Cognitive load for users (is this feature intuitive?)
- Security or privacy concerns
- Impact on the product's reliability

## Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. Examples include:

- Does this feature exist in similar products?
- What lessons can we learn from how competitors handle similar problems?
- Are there any published blog posts or papers that discuss this approach?

## Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through implementation before the feature is released?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed 
in the future independently?

## Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect 
the product as a whole in a holistic way.

Also consider how this all fits into the roadmap for the product.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing.
